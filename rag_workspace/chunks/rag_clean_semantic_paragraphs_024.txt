initial learning curve. 3) Specialization - optimizing RAG to
better serve production environments.
The mutual growth of RAG models and their technology
stacks is evident; technological advancements continuously
establish new standards for existing infrastructure. In turn,
enhancements to the technology stack drive the development
of RAG capabilities. RAG toolkits are converging into a
foundational technology stack, laying the groundwork for
advanced enterprise applications. However, a fully integrated,
comprehensive platform concept is still in the future, requiring
further innovation and development.
F. Multi-modal RAG

transcended

answering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data.
This expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models
that integrate RAG concepts across various domains:
Image. RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal
model of both retrieving and generating text and images.
BLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside
LLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero-
shot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You
Write” method [178] employs image generation to steer the
LM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text
generation tasks.
Audio and Video. The GSS method retrieves and stitches
together audio clips to convert machine-translated data into
speech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad-
vancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by
incorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con-
version [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever-
ages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed-
dings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation.
Vid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal
markers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and
textual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181].
Code. RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by
retrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives
through encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has
demonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera-
tion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK
method [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query
from a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints
within the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph
question-answering tasks.
VIII. CONCLUSION
The summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha-
sizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa-
bilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from
language models with extensive non-parameterized data from
external knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution
of RAG technologies and their application on many different
tasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms
within the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu-
lar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over
its predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI
methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,
has further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in
RAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve
its robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.
RAG’s application scope is expanding into multimodal do-
mains, adapting its principles to interpret and process diverse
data forms like images, videos, and code. This expansion high-
lights RAG’s significant practical implications for AI deploy-
ment, attracting interest from academic and industrial sectors.
