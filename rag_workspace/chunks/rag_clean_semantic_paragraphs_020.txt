Answer Faithfulness ensures that the generated answers
remain true to the retrieved context, maintaining consistency
and avoiding contradictions. Answer Relevance requires that the generated answers are
directly pertinent to the posed questions, effectively addressing
the core inquiry. 2) Required Abilities: RAG evaluation also encompasses
four abilities indicative of its adaptability and efficiency:
noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration,
and counterfactual robustness [167], [168]. These abilities are
critical for the model’s performance under various challenges
and complex scenarios, impacting the quality scores. Noise Robustness appraises the model’s capability to man-
age noise documents that are question-related but lack sub-
stantive information. Negative Rejection assesses the model’s discernment in
refraining from responding when the retrieved documents do
not contain the necessary knowledge to answer a question. Information Integration evaluates the model’s proficiency in
synthesizing information from multiple documents to address
complex questions. Counterfactual Robustness tests the model’s ability to rec-
ognize and disregard known inaccuracies within documents,
even when instructed about potential misinformation. Context relevance and noise robustness are important for
evaluating the quality of retrieval, while answer faithfulness,
answer relevance, negative rejection, information integration,
and counterfactual robustness are important for evaluating the
quality of generation.
