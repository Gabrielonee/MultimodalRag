The ninth until the twelfth rows in Table 3 show vertices 9, 10, 11, and 12 have 
been found and visited, vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 13 have been found, while vertices 6 and 
7 have not found. The route from vertex 1 to vertex 12 is (1, 9, 10, 11, 12) for a total weight 
of 400 meters.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the fifth loop, we have found vertices 1 and 13, because vertex 12 adjacent to 
these vertices. But, vertex 1 has been visited. So, we must chose vertex 13 to visit. Since 
vertices 4, 3, and 2 are close together, we chose these vertices to visit sequentially on the 
6th through 9th loops. Therefore, these three vertices have a status of having been visited 
and are coloured by blue. The route from vertex 1 to vertex 2 is (1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 4, 3, 2) 
for a total weight of 1490 meters.

We find out some vertices that have not yet visited, after visit vertex 2. Since 
vertex 2 is adjacent to vertices 1, 3, 8 and 13, so we find vertex 8. Since vertices 5, 6, 7, 
and 8 are close together, we chose these vertices to visit sequentially until on the final 
loops. Thus, the last customer to visit on this trip is vertex 5.

Next, the courier must return to the starting point, vertex 1, to report the delivery 
results. This step from vertex 5 to vertex 1 is the last loop because there is only one road 
that connects directly between these vertices. Therefore, the final route at this trip as the
