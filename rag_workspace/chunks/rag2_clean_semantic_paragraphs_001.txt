Open-domain QA

Proposition
Figure 1: (Top) An example of three granularities of
retrieval units of Wikipedia text when using dense re-
trieval. (Bottom) We observe that retrieving by proposi-
tions yields the best retrieval performance in both pas-
sage retrieval task and downstream open-domain QA
task, e.g. with Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022) or GTR
(Ni et al., 2022) as the backbone retriever. Highlight in-
dicates the part that contains the answer to the question.
on how the dense retrieval model is instantiated
or trained (Lewis et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021a;
Santhanam et al., 2022; Ni et al., 2022).
In this paper, we investigate an overlooked re-
search question with dense retrieval inference – at
what retrieval granularity should we segment and
index the retrieval corpus? We aim to investigate
this question in two aspects.
• First, we examine how the granularity of the
index affects passage retrieval performance.
• Second, we investigate whether fine-grained units
