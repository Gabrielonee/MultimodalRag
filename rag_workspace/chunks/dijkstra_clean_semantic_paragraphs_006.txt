CONCLUSION

After running Dijkstra algorithm on the initial model graph G, the shortest closed route 
as a subgraph of connected weighted graph G is obtained. This route is a cycle 
(1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 4, 3, 2, 8, 7, 6, 5, 1) with a weight of 1890 meters. This route is a cycle 
that containing every vertex in graph G. A graph of order n is called Hamiltonian if it contains 
a cycle of length n (Lusiani, Baskoro, and Saputro 2017). The number of vertex in graph G is 
13 and the length of  cycle (1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 4, 3, 2, 8, 7, 6, 5, 1) is 13. Therefore, graph G is 
a Hamiltonian.

For different cases, it is possible to find a closed route that is a circuit. Thus this route 
is a closed trail, so the graph G is an Eulerian. In different optimization problems, Neumann 
has shown that a well-known EA variant (1+1) working on encoding important permutations 
can find Eulerian tours of Eulerian graphs in the expected polynomial time (Neumann 2004).

If we pay attention to road direction engineering carried out by traffic police in the 
Sarijadi area, then the graph G will become a digraph (directed graph), which is a graph that 
has directions. In this case, it is possible that a road can only be traveled in one direction, so 
the optimization results by the Dijkstra algorithm will be different.
