This paper studies how the choice of granularity
for indexing a corpus, as well as the granularity
used in the prompts, influences retrieval and down-
stream QA performance. Our results show that
retrieval by propositions outperforms passage-level
and sentence-level retrieval on passage retrieval
and downstream QA across five open-domain QA
datasets. Our analysis shows that indexing a corpus
with finer-grained units enhances the cross-task
generalization of dense retrievers and increases
the density of question-related information in the
prompts. We hope that FACTOIDWIKI and our find-
ings will facilitate future research on information
retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation.
Limitations
The scope of our current study on the granular-
ity of retrieval corpus has the following limita-
tions. (1) Retrieval Corpus – Our study only fo-
cuses on Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, due to
the fact that most open-domain QA datasets adopt
Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus. (2) Types of
dense retrievers evaluated – In the current version
of the paper, we evaluate 6 types of popular dense
retrievers, most of which follow the bi- or dual-
encoder architecture. In future versions, we will
include and discuss results on a broader range of
dense retrievers. (3) Language – Our current study
is limited to English Wikipedia only. We leave the
exploration on other languages to future work.
Ethical Considerations
This article follows the ACL Code of Ethics. Our
work is a foundational research on information
retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, we do
not find obvious risks related to malicious harmful
effects, environmental impact, fairness considera-
tions, or privacy considerations.
