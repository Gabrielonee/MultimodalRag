ABSTRACT 
The determination of the shortest route can be done using various methods, one of which is the Dijkstra algorithm. 
This algorithm is often used in routing problems with minimum weight in computer networks, communication 
networks and transportation networks. There are several applications of the Djikstra algorithm, namely solving 
the problem of the shortest path of neutrosophy, mapping tourism potential, and developing geographic 
information systems in the health sector. In this research, Dijkstra algorithm will be applied to optimize the 
mileage of the delivery of goods packages. Data and information namely the address, weight and number of 
customer packages carried by a courier in one delivery trip are obtained from the drop point of PT. J&T Express 
in Sarijadi area of Bandung City. Meanwhile, data about mileage is obtained from the Google Maps application. 
All this data is used to construct an initial model graph that is a connected weighted graph, where the location of 
a drop point or a customer is a vertex and a road connecting two locations is an edge on the graph. The weight 
in this graph is the mileage from the drop point to the customers or from one customer to another. Then, the 
Djikstra algorithm is run on this graph where the drop point is the starting point of the route, so that the courier 
visits all customers and returns again to the drop point. The resulting route is a cycle in the graph which is the 
shortest closed route at 1890 meters.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In general, the application of the Dijkstra algorithm is optimization in the problems of 
computer networks, communication networks, and transport networks. Theoretically, the 
Dijkstra algorithm is an algorithm used in determining routes in networks with minimum 
weight. This weight is the travel time, mileage, or cost needed during the trip through a route. 
This algorithm was found by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 (Ahmed, Ahmed, and Ahmed 2017). 
Thus, the Dijkstra algorithm can be used for the application of graph theory in the determination 
of the shortest route in the network of the package delivery service companies. The shortest 
route is generated by running the Dijkstra algorithm on the initial model graph, starting from 
the starting point to all other points and returning again to the starting point. Thus, this shortest 
route is a closed route traversed by a courier from a package delivery service company in a trip. 
The graphs used in this study are simple and finite graphs. A graph that is connected and its 
edges have a weight is called a connected weighted graph.  This initial model graph is a 
connected weighted graph, where the weight is the mileage. We call a point in a graph a vertex. 
So, the starting point is the starting vertex. The shortest closed route generated from this 
algorithm can be either a cycle or a circuit. A cycle is a closed route that visits a vertex once, 
otherwise it is a circuit. For example, ùê∂1 = (2, 3, 4, 2) is a cycle, but ùê∂2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5, 1) 
is a circuit in a graph, where {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is a vertex set of this graph (Chartrand, Lesniak, and 
Zhang 2016). 
 
Optimal distribution management capabilities will have a major impact on all aspects, 
especially for freight package delivery service companies. Recently, there have been several 
studies related to delivery service optimization, namely the problem of routing vehicles with 
drones for delivery services using ant colony optimization algorithms (Huang et al. 2022), 
integrating clustering methodologies and routing optimization algorithms for last-mile parcel 
delivery (Ram√≠rez-Villamil et al. 2022), multi-objective optimization of bicycle routes for last-
mile package delivery with drop-off (Osaba et al. 2018), synchronized truck and drone routing 
in package delivery logistics (Das et al. 2020), and a multi-objective optimization approach to 
package delivery by the crowd of occupied taxis (Zhou et al. 2022). 
 
Optimization can also use Prim algorithm to design autonomous drone controls in 
packet delivery (Wirabudi, Hafiza, and Fachrurrozi 2022) and determine the shortest or fastest 
path in logistics distribution (Lusiani, Sartika, Habinuddin, et al. 2021). The Prim algorithm 
can be compared to the Floyd-Warsall algorithm in optimization to determine the shortest path 
(Ramadhan, Siahaan, and Mesran 2018). Using a methodology based on the Prim Algorithm, 
we can improve the reliability index using artificial immune system techniques by applying 
graph theory considerations to improve computational performance and Pareto's rule of 
dominance (Alonso, Oliveira, and De Souza 2014). 
 
As an application in graph theory, a study has been conducted by Ginting et al. in 2019 
on delivery simulation using the Dijkstra algorithm to solve the problem of traveling salesmen 
(Ginting, Osmond, and Aditsania 2019). Dijkstra algorithm can also be used to determine 
current policies and calculate IRL (inverse reinforcement learning) gradients in considering the 
characteristics of food delivery routes (Liu et al. 2020), determine the fastest path in logistics 
distribution by Bulog in the West Java region (Lusiani, Sartika, Binarto, et al. 2021), and solve 
the shortest path problem with fuzzy arc lengths (Deng et al. 2012). The application of graphs 
as models to a problem is not only in determining the shortest path and the fastest path. A graf 
is also used as a model on traffic congestion problems, such as determining waiting times in 
overcoming congestion at the intersection of Toll-Pasteur Bandung road (Lusiani et al. 2020). 
In this article, we will determine the shortest route for delivery service by PT. J&T Express in 
Bandung using Dijkstra algorithm.

METHOD 
 
The model to be analyzed is the case of a package delivery service carried out by a 
courier from a drop point of PT. J&T Express which is located at Jl. Sarijadi Raya No. 90, 
Sukarasa, Kec. Sukasari, Bandung City. The number of customers served by a courier is more 
than 15 customers in one delivery trip depending on the density of demand. In this case, we 
will analysis for 17 customers in 12 locations in the Gegerkalong Hilir and Sarijadi areas. 
Meanwhile, data about mileage is obtained from the Google Maps application. All this data is 
used to construct an initial model graph which is a connected weighted graph, where the 
location of the drop point or a customer is a vertex and the road connecting two locations is an 
edge of the graph. The weight in this graph is the distance traveled from the drop point to the 
customers or from one customer to another. We call the distance traveled is the mileage. Then, 
the Djikstra algorithm is run on this graph where the drop point is the starting point of the route, 
such that the courier visits all customers and returns again to the drop point. 
 
The flow of research methodology can be described as follows. First, collecting of 
customer location/address data. Then, processing location data into distance data traveled from 
one location to another. Second, constructing this data as an initial model i.e. a connected 
weighted graph. Third, running the Dijkstra algorithm  on this graph so that the shortest route 
is obtained. This shortest route should visit all customers and return again to the drop point. 
Thus, this route is either a closed path (cycle) or a closed trail (circuit) that is a subgraph of the 
initial model graph. 
 
The initial model graph is constructed from data on the number of customers, customer 
locations, the existence of roads connecting one location to another, road conditions traveled, 
and mileage between locations. The road connecting these locations must be passable by a 
motorcycle. In this model, if there is no road connecting 2 locations directly then there is no 
edge between the 2 locations. Thus, the initial model graph of this algorithm is a connected 
weighted graph, namely G, as shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
 
Figure 1 The Initial Model Graph G 
 
Vertex 1 is the drop point of PT. J&T Express Sarijadi which is the starting point or the 
initial vertex of the route. Vertex 2 until vertex 13 are customers who will be visited by a 
courier one by one sequentially according to the Dijkstra algorithm. The initial model 
constructed graph is not a complete graph because not all vertices are directly connected to 
other vertices by an edge. It is a graph with 13 vertices and 21 edges. 
 
Figure 2 shows a matrix adjacent of the initial model graph. Matrix elements are 
weights on the edges of the graph. The weight of the edges is the mileage from one location 
to another in meters. The element on the main diagonal of the matrix is zero, since there is

no distance between the same vertices. This matrix is symmetrical, because the mileage 
from vertex i to vertex j is equal to the mileage from vertex j to vertex i. 
 
 
Figure 2 Matrix Adjacent of Graph G 
 
The steps of the Dijkstra algorithm work as follows. The first step is to establish a 
starting point with the status of having been found and has been visited. A courier picks up 
packages of goods sent to customers at the Sarijadi drop point, so vertex 1 is the starting point 
of the route. Thus, the status of vertex 1 has been found and visited. The second step is to find 
other vertices that are adjacent to vertex 1. If these vertices have not yet found, then change 
their status to be found. However, if it has been found then only update the weight. The third 
step is to choose a vertex with a minimum weight to visit.  
 
This second and third steps result in a vertex always being found, if the vertex is 
connected to a vertex that has been visited (in fact, a vertex is found more than once if the 
vertex is connected to some vertices that have been visited). But not all vertex needs to be 
visited. In the optimization process, if a vertex does not have a minimum weight, then the 
vertex does not need to be visited. Next, we repeat the second and third steps, so that all vertices 
have been visited and the courier returns to the initial vertex (vertex 1). The following figure 
and table show the second and third steps in the first loop on Dijkstra algorithm.

Vertex 1 has been determined as the starting point, so in Figure 3, vertex 1 is 
coloured blue to indicate it has been found and visited. The first row in Table 2 shows the 
route from vertex 1 to vertex 1 yields zero weight. In the second step, vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,

9, 12, and 13 are adjacent to vertex 1. Then, these vertices are coloured by red (see Figure 3 on 
the left). Since {1, 9} is the edge with minimum weight of 60 meters, the next vertex to visit is 
vertex 9. So, vertex 9 is coloured by blue (see Figure 3 on the right). This is also shown in the 
ninth row of Table 2.

The ninth until the twelfth rows in Table 3 show vertices 9, 10, 11, and 12 have 
been found and visited, vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 13 have been found, while vertices 6 and 
7 have not found. The route from vertex 1 to vertex 12 is (1, 9, 10, 11, 12) for a total weight 
of 400 meters.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
In the fifth loop, we have found vertices 1 and 13, because vertex 12 adjacent to 
these vertices. But, vertex 1 has been visited. So, we must chose vertex 13 to visit. Since 
vertices 4, 3, and 2 are close together, we chose these vertices to visit sequentially on the 
6th through 9th loops. Therefore, these three vertices have a status of having been visited 
and are coloured by blue. The route from vertex 1 to vertex 2 is (1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 4, 3, 2) 
for a total weight of 1490 meters. 
 
We find out some vertices that have not yet visited, after visit vertex 2. Since 
vertex 2 is adjacent to vertices 1, 3, 8 and 13, so we find vertex 8. Since vertices 5, 6, 7, 
and 8 are close together, we chose these vertices to visit sequentially until on the final 
loops. Thus, the last customer to visit on this trip is vertex 5.

Next, the courier must return to the starting point, vertex 1, to report the delivery 
results. This step from vertex 5 to vertex 1 is the last loop because there is only one road 
that connects directly between these vertices. Therefore, the final route at this trip as the

CONCLUSION  
 
After running Dijkstra algorithm on the initial model graph G, the shortest closed route 
as a subgraph of connected weighted graph G is obtained. This route is a cycle 
(1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 4, 3, 2, 8, 7, 6, 5, 1) with a weight of 1890 meters. This route is a cycle 
that containing every vertex in graph G. A graph of order n is called Hamiltonian if it contains 
a cycle of length n (Lusiani, Baskoro, and Saputro 2017). The number of vertex in graph G is 
13 and the length of  cycle (1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 4, 3, 2, 8, 7, 6, 5, 1) is 13. Therefore, graph G is 
a Hamiltonian.  
 
For different cases, it is possible to find a closed route that is a circuit. Thus this route 
is a closed trail, so the graph G is an Eulerian. In different optimization problems, Neumann 
has shown that a well-known EA variant (1+1) working on encoding important permutations 
can find Eulerian tours of Eulerian graphs in the expected polynomial time (Neumann 2004).  
 
If we pay attention to road direction engineering carried out by traffic police in the 
Sarijadi area, then the graph G will become a digraph (directed graph), which is a graph that 
has directions. In this case, it is possible that a road can only be traveled in one direction, so 
the optimization results by the Dijkstra algorithm will be different.
