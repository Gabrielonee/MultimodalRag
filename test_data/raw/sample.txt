RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It combines a retriever (to find relevant documents) with a generator (to answer questions). This hybrid architecture addresses one of the major limitations of standard language models—namely, their restricted access to external knowledge and their tendency to hallucinate facts. A crucial component of RAG is the use of embeddings, which are dense vector representations of text. Embeddings map words, sentences, or documents into high-dimensional vector spaces where semantic similarity corresponds to geometric closeness. This means that two texts with similar meanings will have embeddings that are close to each other in this space. For example, the sentences "How do I reset my password?" and "Steps to recover account access" would have similar embeddings even if they use different words. These embeddings are generated using pretrained models like Sentence-BERT or other transformer-based encoders, and they allow the retriever to perform approximate nearest neighbor searches efficiently across vast corpora.

In a RAG pipeline, the retriever is typically a dense or sparse vector-based system (such as FAISS or Elasticsearch) that takes a user query and searches a large corpus for the most semantically relevant documents. These retrieved documents are then fed into a generative language model, like GPT or BART, which synthesizes an answer grounded in the retrieved content. The power of RAG lies in this dynamic interaction between retrieval and generation, which enables the system to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant responses than what would be possible from generation alone. By incorporating external knowledge sources during inference, RAG allows models to operate effectively on domains that require detailed, factual grounding—such as scientific literature, legal documents, or technical manuals—without the need for retraining the base model. Moreover, RAG systems are modular: the retriever and the generator can be trained independently or fine-tuned jointly, which allows flexibility in improving different components. For instance, the retriever can be trained with contrastive learning objectives to better distinguish useful documents, while the generator can be fine-tuned on specific answer styles or formats. Another key strength of RAG is its ability to handle open-domain question answering tasks at scale, making it suitable for applications like chatbots, customer support, academic research assistants, and enterprise search. It also opens up possibilities for personalization and adaptability—by modifying the underlying corpus, one can instantly tailor the system to a new domain or user base. Despite its strengths, RAG introduces challenges, such as how to effectively rank retrieved documents, how to handle conflicting information, and how to interpret long or noisy inputs. Nonetheless, RAG represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between static knowledge embedded in models and the dynamic, ever-changing information landscape of the real world.
