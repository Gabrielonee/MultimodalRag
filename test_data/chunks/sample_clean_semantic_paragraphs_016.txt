Fig. 5. In addition to the most common once retrieval, RAG also includes three types of retrieval augmentation processes. (left) Iterative retrieval involves
alternating between retrieval and generation, allowing for richer and more targeted context from the knowledge base at each step. (Middle) Recursive retrieval
involves gradually refining the user query and breaking down the problem into sub-problems, then continuously solving complex problems through retrieval
and generation. (Right) Adaptive retrieval focuses on enabling the RAG system to autonomously determine whether external knowledge retrieval is necessary
and when to stop retrieval and generation, often utilizing LLM-generated special tokens for control. base for LLMs. This approach has been shown to enhance
the robustness of subsequent answer generation by offering
additional contextual references through multiple retrieval
iterations. However, it may be affected by semantic discon-
tinuity and the accumulation of irrelevant information. ITER-
RETGEN [14] employs a synergistic approach that lever-
ages “retrieval-enhanced generation” alongside “generation-
enhanced retrieval” for tasks that necessitate the reproduction
of specific information. The model harnesses the content
required to address the input task as a contextual basis for
retrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the
generation of improved responses in subsequent iterations. B. Recursive Retrieval
Recursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and
NLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results. The process involves iteratively refining search queries based
on the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive
Retrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradu-
ally converging on the most pertinent information through a
feedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide
the retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained
retrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that
systematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It
can be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where
the user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where
the information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The
recursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning
and adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in
improved satisfaction with the search outcomes. To address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and
multi-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursive
retrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve
data in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing
sections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a
retrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary
retrieval within the document refines the search, embodying
the recursive nature of the process.
